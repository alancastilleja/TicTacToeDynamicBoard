# TicTacToeDynamicBoard
A side project I made when my friend gave me an interview question that I thought was too simple.

## How this project came about
A friend of mine sent me a tic tac toe game interview question that wanted him to make a 3x3 board where it competed against the computer. Since I wanted to make things harder for myself, I thought why not make it a dynamic board where the user can make the board as big as they want and the logic still makes sense. That was the challenge I set for myself here

### Bugs I still haven't figured out yet
Since the interview question wanted specific formatting, the rows and columns are not the same when you input them at the start of the game if you go beyond a 3x3 board. For example, a 4x4 board would require you to input 4 for rows and 5 for columns. A 5x5 board would require 5 for rows and 7 for columns, 6x6 would be 6 and 9 etc. The bug is me not knowing how to implement the logic in the create_board function so that it takes 4 and 4 for a 4x4 board without having to hard input it yourself. If you have a solution for that, send me a message.
